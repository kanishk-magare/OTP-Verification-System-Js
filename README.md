# OTP-Verification-System-Js
I'm thrilled to share my latest project: an OTP Verification System that combines the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless user experience. Here's a snapshot of what this project entails:

1️⃣ User-Friendly Interface: Created a visually appealing and interactive webpage using HTML and CSS, ensuring a friendly user interface.
2️⃣ JavaScript Magic: Leveraged JavaScript to generate OTP numbers dynamically and validate user input based on specified conditions.
